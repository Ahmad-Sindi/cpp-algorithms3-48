**Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #48**
**Show All Clients From File (C++)**
--
**🧮 Problem Description**
--
This challenge focuses on reading client records from one or more text files, converting each line into a structured record, and displaying the data in a formatted table.

Each line inside the file represents one client record.

**🔧 Algorithm Workflow**
--
📂 Open one or two text files automatically

📤 Read the file line by line

🔍 Parse each line using the #//# delimiter

📦 Store the extracted data in a ClientStructData structure

📊 Display all clients in a formatted table

**💡 Key Programming Concept**
--
File Parsing & Data Representation
Separating raw file data from structured in-memory representation.

This concept is essential for:

File-based systems

Reporting tools

Administrative software

Legacy applications

**📂 Important File Note**
--
⚠️ The files used in this program are created and stored on **my local machine**.
Anyone applying this idea must:

Create their own text files locally

Ensure correct file names or paths

Have proper read permissions

The program opens files **automatically**—no manual opening is required.

**📂 File Information**
